# jQuery based memory game 

**The game has been developed for educational and training purposes**

## About
This is a memory game that has been developed to showcase skills using JS.
The whole project has HTML, CSS3 and jQuery. The library imports can be viewed at the top of the HTML file. 
While this is original work, all the resources and code fragments that have been used can be found below, in the resources section.  

## Goal
The user has to memorise each card by selecting and viewing the image. The game has been made slightly harder.
Therefore only two attemps are allowed for the user and then the cards are reset back to their original state.

### General
The comments for any functions can be found within the project, for the lines thta are not commented, they are self-explanitory.
Resources are listed below.
